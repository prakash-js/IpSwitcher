#Description:

This tool allows you to automatically change your IP address at user-defined intervals by restarting the Tor service. It uses iptables to redirect all system TCP traffic to Torâ€™s Transparent Proxy port (9040) and DNS queries (UDP port 53) through port 9040, ensuring that both web traffic and DNS requests are routed through Tor.

#Usage Instructions:

Before using the tool, ensure the following lines are added to the end of your /etc/tor/torrc file:

```bash

AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 9040
DNSPort 53
```
